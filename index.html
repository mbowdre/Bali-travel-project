                  <h4>Nusa Penida</h4>
                  <p>
                    Nusa Penida, or Penida Island, is a small island located
                    southeast of Bali in Indonesia’s Klungkung Regency. Whilst
                    located within the province of Bali, Nusa Penida is its own
                    island separate from Bali. Nusa Penida is the largest of the
                    three Nusa Islands, along with Nusa Lembongan and Nusa
                    Ceningan. Still relatively undeveloped. Nusa Penida is a
                    popular tropical holiday destination to visit for its
                    natural landscapes like immaculate beaches, clear blue
                    waters and cliff top views.

                    the best diving spots in Bali, and some even rank on lists

                    diving are excellent here all year round, and there is the

                  three large picturesque lakes; Lake Bratan, Lake Tamblingan,
                  and Lake Buyan On Lake Bratan sits one of Bedugul’s most
                  iconic landmarks, Ulun Danu Beratan, which is known as the
                  floating temple as the pagodas appear to float on the shore.
                  Ceremonies and offerings to the Balinese water and river
                  Goddess Dewi Danu often take place here. The region is one of
                  the best places in Bali for trekking, especially in the
                  tropical jungle between Lake Tamblingan and Lake Buyan. Guided
                  hikes can last a few hours and often include a boat trip
                  across the lake.
